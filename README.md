# LeetCode Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my repository 💪, where I share solutions to LeetCode problems along with brief explanations for each solution 🧠. This collection serves as both a study resource and a reference for anyone looking to improve their problem-solving skills or learn new approaches 🧑‍🎓.

## Repository Structure 🗂️

The repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels:

1. _Easy_: Solutions to simpler problems that are required to build a strong foundation. 🧩
2. _Medium_: Intermediate problems that require more thoughtful approaches. 🔧
3. _Hard_: Challenging problems that demand advanced problem-solving skills. 🧠

Each solution is stored in its respective folder with the following format:

```Format
/<problem_category>/<problem_name>.py
```

For example:

```Example
/Arrays/Two_Sum.py
/Graphs/Shortest_Path_in_Binary_Matrix.py
```

## Problem Explanation 📝

For every problem, I include:

- _Problem Description_: A brief summary of the problem. 📄
- Solution: Code in Python (or another programming language). 💻
- _Explanation_: A step-by-step breakdown of how the solution works, including any optimizations or key insights. 🧩
- _Complexity Analysis_: Time and space complexity for the solution. ⏱️

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Browse the folders to find problems by category or difficulty. 📁
